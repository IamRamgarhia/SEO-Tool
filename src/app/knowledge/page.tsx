      <p>
        Google has 200+ ranking signals, but a small subset accounts for almost
        all of the movement. Stop optimizing for the long tail of folklore —
        focus on these:
      </p>
      <h3>The dominant signals (2026)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Helpful, people-first content</strong> — the Helpful Content
          system is now baked into core. Sites with a high ratio of
          generic-AI-feel pages get suppressed sitewide. Audit ratio, not just
          single pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Quality &amp; quantity of relevant inbound links</strong> —
          links from topically aligned, high-authority sources. One link from
          NYTimes &gt; 100 from random blogs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>E-E-A-T signals</strong> — Experience first (real-world
          usage), then Expertise, Authority, Trust. Critical for YMYL queries
          (your-money-your-life: health, finance, legal).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Search intent match</strong> — does your page answer the
          query in the format searchers expect (list / how-to /
          comparison / definition)? Mismatch loses every time, however good
          the content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Topical authority</strong> — how comprehensively your site
          covers the topic cluster, not just the one page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Page experience</strong> — Core Web Vitals (LCP, INP, CLS),
          mobile-friendliness, HTTPS, no intrusive interstitials.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Freshness</strong> — for queries that demand it (news,
          comparison, &quot;best X&quot;). Last-updated date matters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internal linking &amp; site structure</strong> — clean
          hierarchy, descriptive anchor text, no orphan pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structured data</strong> — eligibility for rich results
          (FAQ, How-to, Article, Product, Recipe, etc.).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What barely matters (or is folklore)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keyword density / TF-IDF tuning to a percentage</li>
        <li>Exact-match keywords in URL slugs</li>
        <li>Meta keywords tag</li>
        <li>Word count by itself (without depth)</li>
        <li>One-H1-only rule</li>
        <li>Domain age</li>
        <li>Bounce rate (Google has confirmed they don&apos;t use it directly)</li>
      </ul>
    </Section>
  );
}

function TopicalAuthority() {
  return (
    <Section id="topical-authority" icon={Layers} title="Topical authority — how the top sites win" accent="cyan">
      <p>
        Topical authority is why Backlinko ranks for nearly every SEO query,
        Yoast for every WordPress-SEO query, Healthline for every symptom.
        They&apos;ve covered the topic so completely that Google trusts them as
        the authoritative source.
      </p>
      <h3>The hub-and-spoke model</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Pillar / hub page</strong> — definitive guide on the broad
          topic (e.g. &quot;Link building&quot;). 3,000-8,000 words, links to all
          spoke pages, ranks for the head term.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spoke pages</strong> — each covers one specific subtopic
          (broken link building, HARO, digital PR, guest posting). 800-2,500
          words each. Each spoke links back to the hub and laterally to
          related spokes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Coverage targets</strong> — to claim authority on a topic
          cluster, plan ~15-30 pages per major cluster. The pillar alone
          isn&apos;t enough.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to plan a cluster (the Backlinko / Ahrefs blog way)</h3>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground">
        <li>Pick the head topic. Find its parent (broader) and sibling topics.</li>
        <li>
          Mine People-Also-Ask, Reddit, Quora, YouTube comments for the actual
          questions people ask. Each becomes a spoke candidate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Audit the SERP: what&apos;s ranking? If listicles dominate top 3, your
          spoke is a listicle. Don&apos;t fight the intent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Build the cluster as ONE batch over 4-8 weeks. Half-built clusters
          underperform — the internal linking only kicks in once the cluster
          is dense.
        </li>
        <li>
          Link the cluster: hub → all spokes, spokes → hub, spokes ↔ peer
          spokes where relevant. Use descriptive anchor text, not &quot;click
          here&quot;.
        </li>
        <li>
          Update the hub every 60-90 days. Re-pulse internal links if you
          shift navigation. Google rewards demonstrably maintained clusters.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Why &quot;publish 1 post a week forever&quot; fails</h3>
      <p>
        Single posts on unrelated topics never compound. Publishing 30 random
        posts is worse than publishing 30 in one tightly-themed cluster — the
        latter unlocks a topical authority boost the former never gets.

      <p>
        &quot;We don&apos;t need a blog, we&apos;re a serious business&quot; loses
        you organic traffic forever. The reason it matters is mechanical, not
        marketing-fluff:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Most informational queries don&apos;t map to product/service
          pages.</strong> Without blog content, you can&apos;t rank for the 90%
          of searches that begin with &quot;how&quot;, &quot;what&quot;,
          &quot;why&quot;, &quot;best&quot;, &quot;vs&quot;. Your competitors
          who do blog will own all of those.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internal links to product pages depend on blog content.</strong>{" "}
          Without articles to host them, your money pages have weak link
          equity from inside the site.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Topical authority requires breadth.</strong> A 6-page
          service site can&apos;t demonstrate authority. A 60-page site with a
          tight cluster around your service category can.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backlink magnets live in blog content, not product pages.</strong>{" "}
          People link to data studies, original research, &quot;ultimate
          guides&quot; — not to your /pricing page.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trust signals.</strong> A blog with author bylines, dates,
          and citations is the cheapest way to demonstrate E-E-A-T.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Knowledge graph eligibility.</strong> Your About + a
          consistent blog-author footprint is what gets you into Google&apos;s
          entity graph.

      <h3>The 12 rules — same ones the top SEO blogs follow</h3>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground">
        <li>
          <strong>One topic per post.</strong> If a post needs 3 H2 sections
          on unrelated subjects, split it into 3 posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Match SERP intent before drafting.</strong> Look at top 5.
          If they&apos;re all listicles, write a listicle. Format mismatch
          loses 100% of the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Open with the answer, not the throat-clearing.</strong> The
          first 100 words must give the visitor a reason to stay.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>One author. Real bio. Real bylines.</strong> &quot;Posted
          by Admin&quot; eliminates E-E-A-T signal entirely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Published date AND last-updated date.</strong> Visible to
          users. In schema. Update old posts and bump the date when content
          materially changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Outbound citations to authoritative sources.</strong> 3+
          per post. Don&apos;t worry about &quot;leaking link juice&quot; —
          Google rewards well-cited content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3-5 internal links per post.</strong> Descriptive anchor
          text. Cross-link old + new posts both directions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Original images / charts / screenshots.</strong> Stock
          photos add nothing. A custom diagram or annotated screenshot earns
          links and image-search traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Schema markup matched to content.</strong> Article + Author
          for posts. FAQ schema only for posts with genuine Q&amp;A. How-To
          schema for actual procedural content. Don&apos;t fake it.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Featured snippet shape on at least one section.</strong>{" "}
          One H2 phrased as the question, paragraph 40-60 words directly
          answering it. Picks up the snippet ~30% of the time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Update before you publish-new.</strong> A
          12-month-old post brought up to date often outperforms a new post.
          Refresh decay candidates first.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>One CTA per post.</strong> Either capture email, drive to
          a service page, or push a tool. Three CTAs = zero conversions.

        <li>
          Hook in the first 12 words. GBP truncates after that on mobile.

          Always a CTA button — Book, Order, Call, Learn more, Sign up. Match
          your business action.

        <li>
          Mix types over the week. All-offers feels spammy; vary
          updates/stories/products.

      <h3>Why daily / consistent matters more than &quot;the perfect post&quot;</h3>

        Google&apos;s freshness signals + GBP&apos;s activity signals reward
        cadence. A site that publishes a decent post every week for 2 years

          request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Audit plugins</strong> — every active plugin loads JS/CSS.

          Settings → Apps. Remove abandoned ones. Each one usually adds
          200-800ms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Theme — use Dawn or a fast paid theme.</strong> Old Sectioned
          themes (Debut) are slow. Page builders (Shogun, PageFly) are slow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Image compression</strong> — &lt;100 KB per product image.
          Shopify renders WebP automatically; just keep source files lean.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Lazy-load with Liquid</strong> — change <code>img_url</code>
          {" "}to <code>image_tag</code> with <code>loading: &quot;lazy&quot;</code>.
        </li>
        <li>

          reviews. Load them after page render.
        </li>

          <strong>next/image with priority</strong> on the LCP image. Set
          width/height to prevent layout shift.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>next/font</strong> for self-hosted fonts. Eliminates the
          render-blocking external font request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>next/script with strategy=&quot;afterInteractive&quot;</strong>{" "}
          for analytics, chat, GTM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic imports</strong> for client-only components below
          the fold. Cuts initial bundle.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>ISR or static rendering</strong> for content that doesn&apos;t
          need request-time data. <code>revalidate: 3600</code> on blog posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Edge runtime</strong> for the parts that can use it. Cuts

      <p>
        Limited control. The honest list of what you CAN do:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Compress images before upload (≤200KB per hero, ≤80KB per gallery)</li>
        <li>
          Disable apps you&apos;re not actively using (each one adds load time)
        </li>
        <li>Reduce custom code in &lt;head&gt; — every embed costs you</li>
        <li>
          Pick a fast template — newer templates are usually 30-50% faster
        </li>
        <li>
          Be honest with the client: Wix/SquareSpace will never beat
          Shopify/Next.js on speed. Compete on content + conversion instead.

          report shows it. 90% of the time it&apos;s the hero image, hero text
          block, or a hero video poster.

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compress + serve modern format</strong> — WebP or AVIF.
          Hero images should be &lt;100KB even on retina.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Eliminate render-blocking resources</strong> — defer
          non-critical CSS, async load JS, push web fonts to swap or use
          font-display:optional.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reduce TTFB</strong> — caching, CDN, faster hosting.
          TTFB above 600ms makes &lt;2.5s LCP almost impossible.
        </li>

        <li>Self-host Google Fonts (or use system fonts)</li>
        <li>Eliminate render-blocking 3rd-party widgets (chat, social buttons)</li>

          <strong>Apache shared hosting</strong> — enable mod_pagespeed if
          available, gzip + brotli, force HTTPS, mod_expires for static cache
          headers.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Nginx</strong> — fastcgi cache for WordPress (TTFB drops
          to ~50ms), gzip + brotli, http2_push for critical CSS, proxy_cache
          for API responses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cloudflare in front of anything</strong> — free, drops
          TTFB globally, Auto Minify + Brotli + Cache Reserve. Single biggest
          ROI optimization.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Vercel / Netlify</strong> — already at the edge. LCP

      <h3>Profile completeness (do once, properly)</h3>
      <ul>

          Business name — <strong>exact</strong> match to signage and
          legal/DBA. Don&apos;t keyword-stuff (&quot;Smith Plumbing - 24/7
          Emergency Plumbers&quot;) — Google demotes for it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Primary category — pick the most specific that fits. Add 3-5
          secondary categories.
        </li>
        <li>
          NAP — name / address / phone — must match website + every
          directory citation exactly.
        </li>
        <li>Hours — including holidays. Update 7 days before holiday closures.</li>
        <li>Service area — only set if you don&apos;t serve from a public address.</li>
        <li>
          Website link — to a relevant landing page, not always the homepage.
          For a multi-location business, link to the location page.
        </li>
        <li>Booking link — if you take appointments. Direct, not via Reserve with Google.</li>
        <li>
          Products / Services — add every one. Each becomes a sub-listing
          Google can index.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attributes — accessibility, payments, identity-owned (women-owned,
          black-owned, etc.) — these surface filters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Photos — 10+ upload, mixed: exterior, interior, team, products,
          customers (with permission).

      <h3>Reviews — the biggest local ranking lever</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Goal: 50+ reviews, 4.5+ avg, 1+ new review per week sustained.</li>
        <li>
          Ask every customer at the moment of peak satisfaction — the day of
          service, not weeks later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a short link (g.page/r/{"<id>"}) on receipts, in email
          signatures, on the &quot;thanks&quot; screen after checkout.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reply to every review within 24h. Yes, even the 5-star ones —
          Google reads the dialog.
        </li>
        <li>
          Negative reviews: empathy + offer to make it right offline. Never
          argue. Never expose customer details.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use review keywords naturally in your replies — they&apos;re indexed
          for the listing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Posts — weekly minimum</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Post 1-3× per week. Mix offers, events, updates, products, stories.
        </li>
        <li>1200×900 image minimum. Google penalizes blurry posts.</li>
        <li>
          Hook in the first 12 words. Always end with a CTA button.
        </li>
        <li>
          Local detail: name the city / neighbourhood / a known landmark.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Citations &amp; consistency</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Top tier: Apple Business Connect, Bing Places, Yelp, Facebook,
          Foursquare, BBB.
        </li>
        <li>
          Niche citations matter more than 100 random directories. A
          dental practice on Healthgrades + ZocDoc beats 50 generic listings.
        </li>
        <li>
          NAP consistency to the punctuation. &quot;Suite 100&quot; vs
          &quot;Ste. 100&quot; vs &quot;#100&quot; should all be normalized.

      <p>
        Many businesses ignore this. Seed your own most-asked questions with

        knowledge panel.

        Google&apos;s knowledge graph is its database of entities (people,
        businesses, places, things). Getting your business / brand / authors
        recognized as entities unlocks the knowledge panel, brand SERP, and
        better citation rates in AI Overviews + LLM answers.
      </p>
      <h3>How to earn knowledge-graph entity status</h3>
      <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-1 text-muted-foreground">
        <li>
          <strong>Wikidata entry</strong> — the cheapest, most direct
          signal. Create one with notable references (news mentions, books,
          academic citations, official site).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Wikipedia article</strong> — only if you meet notability
          thresholds. Don&apos;t game it; admins delete promotional pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Organization / Person schema with sameAs</strong> — link
          your home page to LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Crunchbase, Wikidata,
          Wikipedia. Google reads sameAs as identity-graph evidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistent name everywhere</strong> — same legal name,
          same brand spelling, same logo across all platforms. Inconsistency
          fragments the entity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Authoritative mentions</strong> — news pieces, podcast
          appearances, conference speaker pages, GitHub bio. These build the
          entity association even without links.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Author profiles per writer</strong> — every blog author
          gets a /author/{"<slug>"} page with bio, photo, social profiles,
          full author Person schema, and a list of their published articles.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Brand SERP optimization</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Search your brand name. The first SERP is your reputation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Make sure you control the top 5 results: home, key category, About,
          LinkedIn, Twitter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sitelinks are auto-generated by Google. Help Google by having a
          clean information architecture and keyword-distinct page titles.

      </p>
      <h3>Still produces rich results</h3>

          <strong>Article / NewsArticle</strong> — top stories, byline + date
          enrichment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Product</strong> — price, availability, ratings (only with
          real review aggregator data, not self-attestation).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recipe</strong> — full carousel, cooking time, calories,
          rating.

        <li>
          <strong>Event</strong> — date, location, tickets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FAQ</strong> — only on government and authoritative health
          sites now (rolled back for everyone else in 2023).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How-to</strong> — only on desktop, only for genuinely
          procedural content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Breadcrumb</strong> — replaces ugly URL in result.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Video</strong> — thumbnail + duration in SERP. Critical for
          video content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>LocalBusiness</strong> — opening hours, address, phone in
          knowledge panel.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sitelinks Search Box</strong> — only for established sites
          with strong brand signal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Review (organization-level)</strong> — for service businesses,
          star rating in SERP if from third-party aggregator.
        </li>

        <li>Self-claimed Review schema with no third-party source</li>
        <li>JobPosting (still works but Google for Jobs surface-only)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Implementation rules</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Schema must reflect what&apos;s actually visible on the page. Faking
          it gets a manual action.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use JSON-LD in &lt;head&gt;. Microdata is harder to maintain and
          mix-ups are common.
        </li>
        <li>
          Validate every page in Google&apos;s Rich Results Test before
          considering it shipped.
        </li>
        <li>
          One canonical entity per page — don&apos;t put 5 different schema
          objects representing the same thing.

      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Google Fundamentals of Digital Marketing
          (broad foundation) + Google Search Central docs (skim every section)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Week 3:</strong> HubSpot SEO Certification — fastest to a
          credential

        <li>
          <strong>Week 4:</strong> Google Ads Search Certification — the
          single most marketable cert in this list
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Week 5:</strong> Google Analytics 4 Certification — every
          agency client&apos;s data flows through GA4; nothing else works
          without it
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ongoing:</strong> Ahrefs blog + Moz Whiteboard Friday +
          subscribe to Search Engine Land newsletter. The certs stop teaching
          new things after a few months; the blogs never do.

        💡 All certifications expire 12-24 months after issue. Set a calendar
        reminder to retake — the questions change as the platforms evolve and
        an expired cert is worse than no cert (it signals you stopped learning).
